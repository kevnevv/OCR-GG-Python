# OCR-GG-Python
A Python OCR tool with many search options for an older game called George's Game.

DISCLAIMER: THIS PROJECT WAS SHUT ON APRIL 30TH 2023, THIS CODE HAS ONLY NOW BEEN MADE PUBLIC
WHILST THE ACTUAL INTENT OF THE PROGRAM MAY SEEM UNETHICAL, THIS WAS MERELY AN EDUCATIONAL CHALLENGE BETWEEN ME AND MY FRIEND, AND WE DID NOT WIN ANY ROUNDS.

Context: George's Game was a game where there would be a series of timed questions, you would need to answer all questions correctly within the strict time limit to have a share of the prize pool at the end.

Main Features:

Rectangular selection tool to highlight the question text
Opening the currently saved screenshot
A search button to directly past the text into a Google browser
A search button that added "Valorant Lore" to the end for more specific search results
(Another button that was discontinued)

Most code was written by hand but we did need to use some AI help for some libraries that we never interacted with before, nonetheless, the code was usable for the game (worked perfectly code side, google didn't have good enough answers though)
